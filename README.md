**Map-Reduce** : Hadoop MapReduce (Hadoop Map/Reduce) is a software framework for distributed processing of large data sets on compute clusters of commodity hardware. It is a sub-project of the Apache Hadoop project. 


MapReduce serves two essential functions: it filters and parcels out work to various nodes within the cluster or map, a function sometimes referred to as the mapper, and it organizes and reduces the results from each node into a cohesive answer to a query, referred to as the reducer.
